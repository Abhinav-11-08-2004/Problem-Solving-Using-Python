# Problem-Solving-Using-Python

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from Practice Python (https://www.practicepython.org/), implemented to reinforce core Python fundamentals and programming basics.

The focus is on writing clean, readable, and well-structured Python code while revisiting essential concepts such as control flow, data structures, functions, input/output handling, and basic problem-solving patterns. Each solution reflects a deliberate approach to correctness, clarity, and Pythonic practices.

This repository serves as:
  1. A personal revision log for Python fundamentals
  2. A reference for beginner-to-intermediate Python problem-solving approaches
  3. A demonstration of consistent coding practice and disciplined learning
